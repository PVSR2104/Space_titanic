# Space_titanic
This is a repository containing all the files that I used in space titanic competition in kaggale.com. 
Train.csv dataset has the training data with 14 columns, and no.of rows is around 8000.
Visual is the python notebook to visualize the data.
To compete in this competition, I choosed a artificial neural network with 3 hidden layers.
I used tensorflow framework and keras library to build the deep network.
The current accuracy of the model is 0.77882.
